# Exercise 3 - `for` loops and conditional statements

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand `for` loops and conditional statements in Python.
Below you have a series of problems in which you are asked to create new script files and write the code necessary to produce the desired results.
After making your changes, you will need to upload these files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the end of this document in the [section titled Answers](#answers).

## Problem 1 - Batch processing data files with a `for` loop
This problem is meant to simulate a common problem dealing with data files: batch processing.
Batch processing involves using scripts to process many data files, and one common task is generating a list of filenames that will be processed.
For this problem you will need to create a new script file `animal_file_generator.py` that does the following:

1. Creates a new variable `basename` that contains the text `"Animal"`.
2. Creates a new variable `filenames` that contains the text `""`.
3. Iterates over the number range 0-30 and
  1. Prints the value in `basename` with the numbers in the range to the screen as follows:

      ```
      Animal_0
      Animal_1
      Animal_2
      ...
      Animal_30
      ```
      You will most likely need to use the built-in `str()` function to produce this output. You can learn about how `str()` works by typing `help(str)` in an IPython interpreter window.
  2. Modifies the value in `filenames` to contain the output above plus the file extension for a shapefile `.shp`.
  You must also include a special escape character `\n` to indicate a break in the line after each listed shapefile name.

At the end of the script the variable `filenames` should include a complete list of the different Animal filenames.
The output of `print(filenames)` in your script should be

```
Animal_0.shp
Animal_1.shp
Animal_2.shp
...
Animal_30.shp
```

### Questions for Problem 1
1. What could be some advantages of using a string variable (e.g., `filenames`) to contain a list of files?
2. What are some disadvantages of using a string variable for a list of files, in contrast to a Python list variable?
3. Can you think of any cases where **you** might use a list of filenames like we generate in this exercise?

## Problem 2 - Nested `for` loops
In addition to having single `for` loops that iterate across some variable range, it is possible to *nest* `for` loops within one another.
Consider the example below:

```python
>>> for char in 'dog':
...     for char2 in 'cat':
...         print (char, char2)
    d c
    d a
    d t
    o c
    o a
    o t
    g c
    g a
    g t
```
Here, you can see that in the first pass through the first `for` loop, the value of `char` is `d`.
Entering the inner (or nested) loop, `char2` is set to `c`.
After this, the output is written to the screen and since there are more letters to loop over in the inner `for` loop, the value of `char2` will be updated upon the next pass.
The second time through the inner loop, `char2` is set to `a` while `char` remains `d`.
Like this, the inner loop will run through all of the letters in `cat` for each time that `char` is updated in the outer loop.
It doesn't take too much imagination to figure out this is a very useful concept.

For this problem you should create a new Python script `make_flag.py` that does the following:

1. Creates a variable `star` with text `"*"` and an empty string variable `text`. Recall, you can created empty string variables by assigning `""` as their value.
2. Uses nested `for` loops and the variables above to produce the text formation below when `print(text)` is run at the end of your script.

    ```
    *******
    *******
    *******
    ```
3. Creates a varaiable `line` with text `"-"` and an empty string variable `flag`.
4. Uses nested `for` loops and the variables above to produce the text formation below when `print(flag)` is run at the end of your script. **Note**: You will need to use conditional statements to produce the desired output.

    ```
    *******------------
    *******------------
    *******------------
    -------------------
    -------------------
    ```

### Questions for Problem 2
1. If faced with having to reproduce the character patterns in this exercise with a Python script any way you can, how might you approach this problem differently? For example, let's say you did not need to use the variables `star = "*"` and `line = "-"`.
2. Using nested loops is very common for Python scripts that deal with two-dimensional data such as latitude and longitude, or depth versus distance. Can you think of any cases in which you might use a nested loop in a Python script?

## Problem 3 - Working with projections using conditional statements

In Python there is a handy way of asking input from the user using `input` function such as:

   ```python
   >>> name = input('Please tell me your name:\n')
   Please tell me your name:
   Henrikki
   >>> print("Hello", name)
   Hello Henrikki
   ```

Your job in this problem is to create a new Python script `epsg_finder.py` that:

1. Asks the user for an input value by displaying the text "What is the EPSG value of the input shapefile?"
  - If the user says `4326`, the program prints "EPSG value 4326 corresponds to WGS84" to the screen
  - If the user says `3067`, the program prints “EPSG value 3067 corresponds to ETRS-TM35FIN" to the screen
  - If the user says `2392`, the program prints “EPSG value 2392 corresponds to KKJ / Finland zone2" to the screen
  - If the user enters any other value, the program should print "There are so many spatial references..I don’t know them all, sorry." to the screen

### Questions for Problem 3
1. Did you use any `elif` statements in your Python code? If so, can you think of any way in which you could rewrite you code without using `elif` statements? If not, can you think of any way in which you could rewrite your code to include them?
2. Why did you choose to include or not include `elif` statements in your code? Did it make more sense to use to use them, or was it easier to write your code without?

## General tips
1. Create a general template for your new script files and commit it to GitHub right when you start working on your script(s).
2. Your scripts should also follow the format described earlier in the course with a block comment at the start of the file, inline comments describing how it works and good use of blank lines to make the code easy to read.
3. Look carefully at the requirements for each exercise and be sure to follow them.
4. In case you have forgotten, string variables can be added together. For example,

    ```python
    >>> a = "Taco "
    >>> b = "time"
    >>> c = a + b
    >>> print(c)
    Taco time
    ```
5. The questions after the exercises do not necessarily have correct or incorrect answers, but they are meant to make you think a bit about how you have written your scripts and how they might be applied to your own data/research/studies.

# Answers

## Problem 1

1. & 2.

Using a list of string variables is useful if you only need to store the names or titles of something. However if you would
need to use the variables in the list to calculate something you might run into problems.
3. 
This kind of a list could be useful in for example creating a list of sample locations. You could add location data to each variable on the list.

:dog: ok, 7 pts

## Problem 2

1. 

I think you could just print strings containing the characters needed to form the flag without having to use a for loop. 

2. 

Again this method could be useful for creating a list of sample locations or perhaps for displaying information for some linear study method, e.g. depth of water table along a line.

:dog: alright, 8 pts

## Problem 3

1. & 2.

I used if, elif, and else structure so that the code would look neat and be easily readable. I could have also used nested if and else statements but that would have caused the code to have multiple layers of intendation and it would have looked messy.
Simple is beautiful.
